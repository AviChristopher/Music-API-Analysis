# Music-API-Analysis

This project analyses 10 Oscar-winning movies and their IMDB ids. 
Using the OMDb API and the IMDB ids , data was generated from https://www.omdbapi.com/ and saved  into a CSV file. 
The following questions were answered using Jupyter lab.

1)(Graph) What was the runtime for each movie?
2)What movie had the longest runtime?
3)Is there any relationship between the length of the movie (runtime) and the number of awards a movie won?
4)(Graph) How many awards and nominations did each movie receive?

The results were then used in a powerpoint presentation.
